# 202C-Gibbs_Cluster_Sampling_For_Ising_Model
Cluster sampling of the Ising/Potts model

This project is a continuum of Project 2. For simplicity, we consider the Ising model in an n x n lattice (n is between 64 and 256) with 4-nearest neighbor. X is the image (or state) defined on the lattice and the variable Xs at each site s takes value in {0, +1}.
